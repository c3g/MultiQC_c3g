    Those metrics are calculated according to IHEC standards, following the IHEC [documentation](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-assay-standards/tree/master/qc_metrics/chip-seq/script). The metrics from [[spp]] (ENCODE metrics) are also calculated following the [documentation](https://github.com/kundajelab/phantompeakqualtools) and included to the IHEC metrics table.

    The alignment file per sample is filtered using [[samtools]]. All alignments with MAPQ smaller than **5** and all unmapped and duplicates reads are excluded from the resulting file in BAM format.
    General summary statistics are provided per sample. Sample readsets are merged for clarity.
