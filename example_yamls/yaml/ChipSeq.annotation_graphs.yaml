    The following figures show different peak location statistics per design. The first figure consists of a pie chart that shows the proportions of the genomic locations of the peaks. The locations are:

    1. Gene (exon or intron)
    2. Proximal (2 kb upstream of a Transcription Start Site)
    3. Distal (between 10 kb upstream and 2 kb upstream of a Transcription Start Site)
    4. 5d (between 100 kb upstream and 10 kb upstream of a Transcription Start Site)
    5. Gene Desert (>= 100 kb upstream or downstream of a Transcription Start Site)
    6. Other (anything not included in the above categories)

    The second and third figures illustrate the distribution of peaks found within exons and introns. The last figure shows the distribution of peak distance relative to the Transcription Start Sites (TSS).
