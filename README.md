### What is this repository for? ###

This plugin allows C3G to write MultiQC extensions for custom pipeline reporting. 

### How do I get set up? ###

1- First take a look at the MultiQC resources below to see if the tool you need is already supported.

2- If not, contact [Rola Dali](rola.dali@mail.mcgill.ca) to dicuss the tool and its uses and to decide if it goes in the main MultiQC repo or in the C3G plugin
